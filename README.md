# big_data_challenge
Following the prompt of the big data challenge being factors affecting clean energy, this project aimed to analyze different datasets on the topic.
Topics include:
- Societal factors in clean energy capacity in rural towns such as access to roads, comparing indigenous and non-indigenous communities, and across different provinces in Canada
- Seeing how GINI index of a country relates to its clean energy usage
- Comparing different clean energy sources and their usage over time
- Comparing prices for clean technologies such as EVs and what factors play into price

The analysis was done using python and sci-kit learn with ML algorithms such as mean shift, and linear regression, and graphing results using Matplotlib

Our final report was on Factors that affect renewable energy generation in remote communities. It can be viewed here:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j3_6b42W6Ym-7OtCsiM0jnX7szqFDI1z/view
